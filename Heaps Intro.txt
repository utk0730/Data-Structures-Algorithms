/*
Heaps are treee with some special feature additions.
Binary Heap - 1> Max Binary Heap
            - 2> Min Binary Heap

Binary Heap is similar to Binary Search Tree but with
some different rules.
Parent node can have atmost two child.(Binary heap).
There is no relation betweeen Sibling nodes.
 
 USES : -Binary Heap are commonly used to implement Priority Queue
        -Also used quite a bit in Graph Traversal

MaxBinaryHeap - parent node is always greater than its child nodes
MinBinaryHeap - parent node is always less than its child nodes
