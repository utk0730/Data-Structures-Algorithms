types of trees
------------------
-> Trees - non-linear data structure that contains a root with child nodes
-> Binary trees - Trees in which each node can have at max 2 child(binary)
-> Binary search trees - special case of binary tree, 
                       - sorted in a particular order
                       - parentNode > all nodes to left of it
                       - parentNode < all nodes to right of it
