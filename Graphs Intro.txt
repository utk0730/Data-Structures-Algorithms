Graphs
---------
Graph is a collection of nodes and connection between them.
uses:
-----1> socila network
     2> Maps/locations
     3> Routing algo
     4> everywhere :P


In mathematics, and, more specifically, in graph theory, 
a TREE is an undirected GRAPH in which any two vertices are 
connected by exactly one path. Every acyclic connected graph is a tree, 
and vice versa.

In short - trees are special graph(undirected graph) in which nodes are connected
in such a way that there is only one path from a node to a given node 


Types of Graphs
----------------
1> Directed graph - edges have a polarity, represented by arrows
                  - ex - Instagram followers model
2> Undirected graph - edges dont have a polarity
                    - facebook friends
3> Weighted graph - edges have a value associated with them(info about the connection)
4> Unweighted graph - edges with no vlaues
5> Directed weighted graph - ex -one way roads in google maps
6> Udirected weighted grpah - ex- two way roads in google maps
